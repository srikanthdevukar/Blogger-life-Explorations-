          The Fashion Camera is another incredibly useful resource for
          photographers navigating an often-tumultuous industry. Liselotte
          Fleur, who oversees the site and is its chief blogger, peppers in her
          personal stories about what it’s actually like to be a fashion
          photographer (including, for example, how you can land your first book
          cover. With over 12 years of experience, including work with top
          brands across Europe, Fleur’s long-standing photo blog is a boon to
          fashion shooters.

          Street photography is one of the most challenging but at the same time
          one of the most rewarding genres of photography. Documenting people in
          their everyday environment is not easy – it requires patience, hard
          work and sometimes even some bravery to be able to approach and
          photograph complete strangers.

          While Mashable falls mostly in the category of a lifestyle blog, the
          platform publishes a vast amount of tech based content that draws a
          wide readership. The mix includes technology news, opinions, how-to
          guides, and more. With an audience of over 45 million readers,
          Mashable’s influence in the technology field cannot be overlooked.
          Mashable was founded in 2005 by Pete Cashmore. <br> Over time, the blog
          grew into a burgeoning media company due to its signature style of
          publishing short, easily digested posts. The platform was sold to
          digital media company, Ziff Davis, in 2019 and now has a team of tech
          writers and editors based in different countries around the world.

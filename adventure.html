          Are you one of those people who respond to “Take a hike!” with “Yes
          please!”? Then trekking is your adventure travel soul mate. So much of
          this big, beautiful world can only be reached by mountain trails and
          rugged foot paths. Whether you’re an experienced climber or just
          dipping your toes in the water, breathtaking (literally) trails around
          the world are calling you to put boots to dirt and hit the road.

          “That one time at band camp” became a cliche for a reason: because
          summer camp is the ultimate source of absurd and wonderful adventures
          – the kind you can embarrass your grandchildren with for decades to
          come. Count on plenty of crafting with natural materials, group
          hiking, and schmoozing with co-eds on your summer camp adventure
          travel program. The campfire songs and s’mores at the end of each
          night are just the icing on the cake.
